# CAPM Portfolio Optimization with Risk Aversion Adjustment: Find your Optimal Investment Portfolio for Retirement by filling out our Survey
## Project Purpose:
In the modern investing landscape, the traditional approach of using a 60:40 stock-bond approach is prevalent. This strategy involves allocating 60% to stocks and 40% bonds at the beggining of one's life, then typically flips those weights after retirement. This aims to provide a simplified balance between growth potential from stocks and stability from bonds.
